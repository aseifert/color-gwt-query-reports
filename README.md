# Color Google Webmaster Tools Query Reports

Colors search query performance as shown by Neil Patel (but slightly altered) in his [blog post](http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/12/30/how-3-simple-google-analytics-reports-will-increase-your-search-engine-traffic/)


Features:

* colored CTR and Position fields
* more accurate CTR on main query page


TODO:

* right side CTR y-axis labels
* draws the CTR graph only on page reload, not when we navigate between reports
